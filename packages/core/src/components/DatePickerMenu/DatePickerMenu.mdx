## Usage

### When to use
- When users need to select a date range (start and end date).
- When quick selection options (e.g., "Last 7 days", "This Month") are beneficial.
- When a dual-month view is needed for easier range selection across months.

### When not to use
- For single date selection (use a simple DatePicker instead).
- When screen space is extremely limited (consider a mobile-optimized picker).

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Use quick selections for common ranges to save user clicks. | ❌ Don't use for single date inputs where a simple calendar suffices. |
| ✅ Provide visual feedback for selected ranges. | ❌ Don't hide the "Apply" and "Cancel" buttons; they are crucial for confirmation. |
| ✅ Use event dots to highlight important dates if applicable. | ❌ Don't overwhelm the user with too many quick selection options. |
